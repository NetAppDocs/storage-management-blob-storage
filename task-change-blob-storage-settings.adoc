Once your Azure Blob Storage system is available in the Systems page, you can change some storage account properties directly from the NetApp Console.

Note that you can't change the storage account name, Azure region, or the performance type of the storage.

The storage account properties you can change includes:

* The Subscription and Resource Group for the storage account.
* Add, change, or remove tags for the objects that are added to the storage account.
* Whether or not new objects added to the storage account are encrypted, and the option used for encryption.

You can change these storage account settings directly from the Connsole by selecting image:button-horizontal-more.gif[the three dots more button] for a storage account.
