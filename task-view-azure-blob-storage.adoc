After you install a Console agent in Azure, the NetApp Console can automatically discover information about the Azure storage accounts that reside in the Azure Subscriptions where the Console agent is installed. An Azure Blob system is added to the Systems page so you can view this information.

You can see details about your Azure storage accounts, including the location, resource group, used capacity, and more. These accounts can be used as destinations for operations from NetApp Backup and Recovery, NetApp Copy and Sync, and NetApp Cloud Tiering.
